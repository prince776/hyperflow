# HyperFlow

A basic implementation of HTTP2 in rust. This implementation receives http2 requests and
provides them to a handler function in http 1.1 semantics. Response returned by the
handler in http 1.1 semantics is then converted to http2 and sent.

This implementation has been tested with a basic GET and POST request via `h2load`.

See the h2load succesfully received response from our rust impl of h2.

This implementation is NOT http2 compliant, however it can be extended to do so.
I however doubt I'll continue this project as this project was mostly for learning about http2
by reading the rfc and practicing some rust.

## Development

```
$ cargo run # to run the server
$ h2load http://localhost:8080 -v# to make http2 req
$ sudo tshark -i any -f "tcp port 8080" -Y "http2" -V # to monitor http2 requests
$ ~/Downloads/h2spec -p 8080 http2 # for checking compliance, you might have it somewhere else.
```
